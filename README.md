# Adult income dataset
The adult dataset comes from the USA repository machine learning databases. The extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 census database and it has 48842 samples. Our aim is to perform a supervised analysis, testing different models in order to predict whether an individualâ€™s annual income exceeds $50,000 based on some independent variables
